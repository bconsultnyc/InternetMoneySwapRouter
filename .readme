API_KEY=your_api_key_here
SECRET_KEY=your_secret_key_here
DATABASE_URL=your_database_url_here
```

### Step 2: Database Setup
Ensure your database is set up and accessible. Update the `DATABASE_URL` in the `.env` file with your database connection string.

### Step 3: Application Configuration
Review and update the `config.py` file to match your environment settings. This may include API endpoints, timeout settings, and other configuration parameters.

## Usage
